# ðŸ¤  An Adventurer's End
An Adventurer's End was a game I made in around 4 days for the ONE LAST GAME JAM 2023. It was my first time using Godot and I spent most of my time familiarising myself with the engine rather than progressing with the game. This meant that towards the very end I wrote some atrocious code. Have fun snooping around my terrible code!
